Tensorflow Code for generating new artwork combining different Style and Content to create a new Generated image

The model is based on pretrained network VGG-19 and loads the weights directly.

Code for downloading weights: model = load_vgg_model("imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat")

This is under active development and update, will post the changes as and when it is done

The base code is based on the Coursera Deep Learning Specialization -> Convolution Neural Networks by AndrewNG
